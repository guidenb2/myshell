SYNOPSIS
   ./myshell [OPTIONAL_ARG] [OPTION I/O REDIRECTION]

DESCRIPTION
   myshell is shell program that allows the user to input commands. The program is a command line interpreter

COMMANDS
   cd [DIR] - change to directory DIR. If no nothing entered for DIR, the current working directory is printed

   clr - clears the screen

   dir - list files and directories in current directory 

   environ - lists all environment strings

   echo [ARG] - prints ARG

   help - displays user manual

   pause - pause the shell program until the 'Enter' key is pressed

   calender - displays a calender of the current month with the current date highlighted

   quit - quit the shell

I/O REDIRECTION
   This is the redirecting of standard input or standard output. Standard input usually comes from the command line but can be taken from a file if the following is provided: COMMANDNAME < input.txt. This would make our stdin come from input.txt rather than from the command line. Input is taken until the EOF is reached. 
   Output can be redirected to by: COMMANDNAME > output.txt OR COMMANDNAME >> output.txt. Output would be redirected to the file output.txt and wouldn't be output to the terminal. > overwrites the contents of output.txt but >> appends to output.txt 

ENVIRONMENT
   Text

BACKGROUND EXECUTION
   If a process is run in the background, the parent process does NOT wait for it to finish before receiving more user input. A background process is a process that is run independently[2]. If a terminal launches a background process, the same terminal can execute other commands without waiting for the background process to finish.
   To run a command in the background use '&' after the command, i.e. COMMANDNAME [ARG] &
